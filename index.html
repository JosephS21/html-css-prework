        <h1><u>About Me&#11015</u></h1>
        <p>For starters i'm 26 years of age, and only getting older. I currently am unemployed as i have all my focus on Coding Temple. I've always been intrigued with coding but never really got an oppurtunity to try it, i've been more in the bussiness field my whole life. 
            I'm really excited at the oppurtunity to push myself and learn all i can about programming. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, California and still live here til this day, hard to see myself anywhere else after so long. I recently have tried to make health a prority in my life,
             so i been going to the gym a lot and trying to stay as consistent as possible. I love the progress i made, wish to make it a lifestyle now.</p>

        <figure>
        <p>I grew up loving to play games and sports! When it comes to games i'm as competitive as psooible. I love challenging games and love to win them. We can be playing anything from <i>Uno</i> to <i>Call Of Duty</i> or even<i> League of Legends.</i>
            No matter what the game is you will know i'm trying my hardest to win. As for sports i grew playing every sport possible but the older i got i mainly played basketball and football. I love to watch as well, growing up in the Bay you are a <i>Warriors</i> fan no matter what but as 
            for football you have a hard choice to make either the San Fransico <i>Niners</i> fan or Oakland (really Las Vegas now) <i>Raiders</i> fan. As for me i'm a <i><s>Niners</s></i> <i>Raiders</i> fan which you probably know already by the logo. I've been a fan for the ups and
        many many many downs we've had. When it comes to basketball i'm a die hard <i>Celtics</i> fan!</p>

        <h1><u>Dogs &#128054</u></h1>
        <figure>
        <p>I love animals! I've had dogs in my life through out my life, all my friends have dogs as well. My dog is literally my best friend, i believe dogs are truly mans best friend(sorry women). If i could now i would have as many dogs as possible they are just great, they all have such unique 
            personalities that i love so much. Dogs love you unconditionally no matter what and to really understand that and feel that is amazing. I would recommend a dog to any one that could truly take care of one and looking for a pet. Basically all in all i do really love aniamals but love my dog
            even more!
